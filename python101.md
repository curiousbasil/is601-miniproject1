# Python 101: Definitions, Concepts and Examples

## How Python uses Indentation to control Flow

### In simple Terms:

Python uses indentation to control flow by defining a block of code. 

### Some Detail:

A code block starts with indentation and ends with the first unindented line. 
The amount of indentation must be consistent throughout that block. For instance, four whitespaces are used for indentation.

## Don't Repeat Yourself

### In simple Terms:

The Don't Repeat Yourself principle states that duplication in logic should be eliminated via abstraction. 

### Some Detail:

Adding unnecessary code increases the amount of work required to maintain the software in the future. Duplicate code adds to technical debt. 
Duplication decreases the quality of the code.
